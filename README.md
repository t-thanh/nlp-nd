# Master Natural Language Processing
Learn cutting-edge natural language processing techniques to process speech and analyze text. Build probabilistic and deep learning models, such as hidden Markov models and recurrent neural networks, to teach the computer to do tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, and more!

## Introduction to Natural Language Processing
Learn text processing fundamentals, including stemming and lemmatization. Explore machine learning methods in sentiment analysis. Build a speech tagging model.

## Computing with Natural Language
Learn advanced techniques like word embeddings, deep learning attention, and more. Build a machine translation model using recurrent neural network architectures.

## Communicating with Natural Language
Learn voice user interface techniques that turn speech into text and vice versa. Build a speech recognition model using deep neural networks.

# Projects of Natural Language Processing

1. [Part-Of-Speech Tagger with Hidden Markove Model](https://github.com/udacity/hmm-tagger)

Use several techniques, including table lookups, n-grams, and hidden Markov models, to tag parts of speech in sentences, and compare their performance.

2. [Neural Machine Translation with Recurrent Neural Networks](https://github.com/udacity/aind2-nlp-capstone)

Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation. Youâ€™ll be able to explore several recurrent neural network architectures and compare their performance.

3. [End-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks](https://github.com/udacity/AIND-VUI-Capstone)

Build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline. The model will convert raw audio into feature representations, which will then turn them into transcribed text.
